# Changelog

## Version 0.2.0 (2026-02-13)

### Features
- **About Page** — Purpose, data security, author info, GitHub link, license, and warranty disclaimer
- **App Branding** — Renamed to "SPERT® Story Map" with registered trademark symbol
- **Dismissible Warning** — localStorage warning banner can now be closed (reappears on next visit)

### Bug Fixes
- **Duplicate product** — `releaseCardOrder` now correctly remaps release and rib IDs
- **Progress history** — `getProgressOverTime` and `getReleaseProgressOverTime` now use `getRibItemPercentCompleteAsOf()` for correct sprint ordering
- **Delete cleanup** — Deleting ribs, backbones, themes, and releases now cleans stale IDs from `releaseCardOrder`
- **Progress input** — Clearing the sprint progress field now sets value to 0 instead of being ignored

### Technical
- Extracted `RibCard` and `AllocationModal` into `src/components/releases/`
- Created shared `useProductMutations` hook for DRY hierarchy updates
- Added documentation: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Added footer with version link and changelog page (reads `CHANGELOG.md` at runtime)
- Removed unused `App.css` and `@dnd-kit` packages
