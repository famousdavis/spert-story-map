# Changelog

## Version 0.3.0 (2026-02-13)

### Features
- **Per-release progress tracking** — Progress is now tracked per-release per-sprint instead of globally per-rib. Split-allocated items show separate rows for each release with target ceiling enforcement
- **Assessment notes** — Expandable rows in the progress table let teams capture reasoning for each sprint's progress assessment, with auto-timestamped history shown newest-first
- **Expand All / Collapse All** — Toggle button to open or close all comment panels at once for scanning notes across the board
- **Multi-expand** — Multiple rows can be expanded simultaneously (previously only one at a time)
- **Alphabetical sorting** — Progress table items sorted by backbone → rib name (release grouping) or rib name (backbone/theme grouping)
- **Allocation memo field** — Each release allocation line can carry a free-text memo

### Bug Fixes
- **Progress input clearing** — Clearing a sprint progress value now removes the entry entirely instead of writing 0, fixing broken delta calculations
- **Comment-preserving clear** — When clearing progress on a row with an assessment note, the note is preserved (progress set to 0 instead of deleting)

### Technical
- Schema version bumped to v2 with waterfall migration for legacy progress entries
- `progressHistory` entries now include optional `comment` and `updatedAt` fields
- `removeProgress` function for clean entry deletion
- `expandedRows` changed from single string to Set for multi-expand support
- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CLAUDE.md` with new patterns

## Version 0.2.0 (2026-02-13)

### Features
- **About Page** — Purpose, data security, author info, GitHub link, license, and warranty disclaimer
- **App Branding** — Renamed to "SPERT® Story Map" with registered trademark symbol
- **Dismissible Warning** — localStorage warning banner can now be closed (reappears on next visit)

### Bug Fixes
- **Duplicate product** — `releaseCardOrder` now correctly remaps release and rib IDs
- **Progress history** — `getProgressOverTime` and `getReleaseProgressOverTime` now use `getRibItemPercentCompleteAsOf()` for correct sprint ordering
- **Delete cleanup** — Deleting ribs, backbones, themes, and releases now cleans stale IDs from `releaseCardOrder`
- **Progress input** — Clearing the sprint progress field now sets value to 0 instead of being ignored

### Technical
- Extracted `RibCard` and `AllocationModal` into `src/components/releases/`
- Created shared `useProductMutations` hook for DRY hierarchy updates
- Added documentation: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Added footer with version link and changelog page (reads `CHANGELOG.md` at runtime)
- Removed unused `App.css` and `@dnd-kit` packages
